1. create a folder called react in the desktop
2.we opened a command prompt double click the folder go on top adreess bar and remove that and type cmd and enter then cmd will open
3.check the version  (node -v)
4.npm -v 9 check verion of npm
5.creating react app based on the command: npmx create-react-app demo
6.npm start
7.to make it work :
    1.open ur react and check demo file was created or not?
     2.go to cmd prompt  and 

1. index.html, 2. index.js, 3. index.cs
initially do or write your code app.js
unlike html here once dom gets created the changes or manipulation what we do gets completed and only that part will be rerendered
 whereas in html everytime we make change entire dom will be rerendered

in the web application created by react js each and everything is called as components 
types of components : 1. functional component 2. class component 

JSX - html inside javascript

day 4:
every component will have props and states:;
1.props : it wont change ex: name, tata bislery brand            2.states: it changes or re can change it ex: water level in bottle .....initial state full after drank the water it become l
                                                                      low , updated state half and current state empty.
 
flipkart website:
component name: mobiles, props : name, version , price

earlier in it industry they were using class components reason being state concept wass not available with functional component
hooks is used to implement state in functional components; 
types of hooks 
1. use State
2. use Effect
3. use Ref
4. use Context
5. use Reduce
 example of hook state : counter clock , stating the initial state aas zero we can implemented decremented reseted using use state hook.

day 5:
combine two array with using hook and without hook
spread operator: passing array into use state


day6:
use effect-1
upon the condition or action we applied in our functional components monitoring the impact or side effects can be done using use effect hook 
use effects acpt two argumments 1. call back function , 2. dependency arry[]
note: call back function is like constructor in java

day 9:
use effect: ?
usereducer: same as usestate to manage or update states that is data that is values of components. difference is if u have more states or complex things u use usereducerr hook.
step1: create increment decre program using usestate
step2: replace usestate with use reducer
note:  point 1: usereducer takes 2 arguments first is reducerfunction which syas what u want to do (like inc or dec), second is initial value of state

point2: usereducer return s array with two values like usestate
first is that initial count and second is dispatch function we call them as stae and dispatch 

here state will hold initial value   and updated once u called dispatch function , and dispatch will trigger use reducer function

redux:

function jsobdisplay(){
var obj ={
number:100
name: "Abishek"
}
return {
<div>
<h1>{obj.number}</h1>	
<h1>{obj.name}</h1>
</div>
)}

geta pass from the user as a input if the pass is correct display the component login granted , if the pass is incorrect display the access denied component.a

day10:
redux:        Redux is a state management library that helps manage and centralize application state in a predictable way. It uses a unidirectional data flow, making it easier to debug and maintain applications

router
routes
route
path
route
routes
router

step1: create this using routing  , home users about contact
useSelector hook - To Access data from redux
explanaton: state is reducer userfinfo from store users from slice 

day10:

day11:
compass:
compass helps to fetch data from mongo db from mongo dv server means compass helps u to reach mongo db.. like its client 

Mongodb:
create records in computers collection with modelName, brandName, releaseYear, warranty, price
fileter all the records wwith the price range 30000 to 50000 range and go with the asus

dbproducts.find({$and:[{price:{$gt:800000}},{brand:'Apple'}]})
db.customers.find({$and:[hobbies:{$exists:false}}},{age:{$gt:40}}]})
db.companies.aggregate([{$lookup:{from: 'employees',localField:'-

create a database bank , create two collection under then , first collection name is customer personal, second collection name is customer account , name string,address array, phone NO object
with two numbers and names is one and two , age 
second collection data model and schema... acc number(int), branch ( string, bank name (string , ifsccode(string), current balance , accc type, over draft but overdraft should be yes or no  this is condition
1. where only the od is yes
2. Display only the customers add, where the brands names are same
3.current balance 10,000 to 20,000 
4.filter only the saving acc people details
5.

nodejs:
node is a backend library frim js
in Node, we can use express js as middleware.
const http= require('http');
const express = require('express');
const sayHello = require(./greet');

nodejs:
its a popular js library or we call it as runtime environment which allows us to run the javascript at the service time 
noe: maintain split terminals in vs code(2) inorder to use client and server 
1. runcommand : start the server first command: node server.js
2.command to runclient : npm start
terminal : npm i express

we can delete package.json and also to get it back the command is npm init -y
AxIOS:
   its a popular js library used to make http request from the browser or nodejs
asios is known for easy and clean syntax also flexibility. especially work well with api and rest api
when we write an apo i for an exclusive purpose we call it as rest api

CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing 
when a web page request information froma  resource (from anyu other sites ), whether to acpt the request and process it or not , will be defined be in the rule book for this purpose we use cors.

commands to install npm i axios 
npm i cros

note: so 


next day: User.js one file, second file update.js tird 
model,name, age, email .... one button as add user ... after click the button it should be store in mongoDb
